# NeoVim and VimTeX Config For Supercharged Mathematical Typesetting

This is my Neovim config along with my VimTeX note-taking setup inspired by this [Blog](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) by [@gillescastel](https://github.com/gillescastel) and this [Guide](https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/) by [@ejmastnak](https://github.com/ejmastnak)
